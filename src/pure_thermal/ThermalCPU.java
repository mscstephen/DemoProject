//Therefore, constants weight and specific heat capacity form constant 3.63.
//intensity is in watts, or J/s. epoch is 10 secs, so each watt goes to 10J.
//Dividing 3.63 by 10 compensates from having to calculate this. -> 0.363.
//0.363 is still in units kJ/K, as already multiplied kg. However, other side of equation is in J, not kJ.
//converting 0.363 to J gives 363J/K.
//Q/mc=T
